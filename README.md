# BufQueue

# Constraints & Limitations:

1. Number of subscribers, Queue Size and Map Size (n) has been initialized with default values for now. This would be
improved in next version.
2. All the input like type of messages, data generates randomly and pushes into some queue without any order.
3. Queue size (B) is also random value and flushes the queue when it has reached the max queue size.
4. For now, all the subscribers are listening to every queue, which can be customized next version.
5. For now a single publisher is sending data to Q, but when there are N number of publishers there will be a problem
with concurrency which need to handle.
